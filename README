This is a collection of python scripts which can be used to analyze RNA-Seq datasets. The scripts were written mainly to work with SOLiD data but they could be used for files from other technologies as well.

The toolbox contains scripts for ...

* RPKM calculation 
* NTR identification
* splice detection
* alternative splicing analysis
* others

Currently its just a collection of scripts. I will add documentation and optimize them for speed in the comming weeks.

As of now these scripts are at the prototype stage.
